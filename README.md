# JAVAwithMe 
<h2>Let' s learn JAVA together! :woman_technologist:</h2> 
This repository includes little Java projects and some important information about Java. There are Turkish notes on my code pages(comment lines):woman_cartwheeling:.<br> 
I created this repository because nowadays I learn Java with Engin Demirog course on Udemy :computer: and I write his code on Intellij IDEA and I take some notes in Turkish, so I created this to share my notes :nerd_face: and maybe I can help someone to understand the important points of Java :hugs:. I' ll take notes and I write them in my README :page_facing_up: document.<br>

<h5>Let's start! :arrow_forward: </h5>
